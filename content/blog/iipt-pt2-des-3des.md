# DES/3DES: When 64 Bits Just Ain't Enough Anymore (A Cryptographic Trip Down Memory Lane)

Welcome to Part 2 of our "Insights in Plaintext" series! After laying the groundwork in our introduction to cryptography, we're diving deep into our first case study: DES and 3DES. These algorithms once reigned supreme but have now been standing as fascinating monuments to the never-ending march of technical progress. Not so long ago, these ciphers were the guardians of sensitive data all over the world. Today they serve as crucial cautionary tales about complacency in cryptography. So, grab your virtual (or real) coffee mug and let's explore how these pioneering encryption standards shaped the security landscape we covered in Part 1.

## From Bell Labs to Bit Rot: A History Lesson

Our story starts in the 1970s, a decade of groovy music, now questionable fashion choices, and the birth of modern cryptography. The powerhouse IBM, in its infinite wisdom (or perhaps with a nudge from the NSA), developed the Data Encryption Standard (DES). YES! It was the IBM. DES was a block cipher designed to protect sensitive government and commercial data. It was designed with a 56-bit key, a seemingly insurmountable barrier at the time, which gave a false sense of security. Remember this was the time when 800Kb floppy disks were state-of-the-art. Banks, eager to safeguard their customers' financial transactions, embraced DES with open arms. Little did they know that the seeds of its demise were already sown.

What followed was the rise of distributed computing and Moore's Law. The technological advancement gradually chipped away at DES's armor. What once seemed unbreakable began to show cracks. The final blow came in 1998, with the infamous [EFF's Deep Crack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker) project, a crowdsourced effort to break DES. This sent shockwaves through the security community. One thing became painfully clear: Fort Knox was made of cardboard, and the chihuahua was asleep on the job.

The scramble for a solution led to the creation of 3DES, or Triple DES. It was a band-aid attempt to bolster DES's security without completely reinventing the wheel. Why? Because we didn't have the time to do so back then (more on this later). 3DES, as the name suggests, applies the DES algorithm three times, effectively increasing the key size to 112 or 168 bits. It was always a temporary fix, never a cure. An intermediate solution to buy us more time to move to something else. While 3DES offered improved security compared to its predecessor, it also ended up inheriting DES's fundamental limitations. All of this while adding the burden of significantly increased computational overhead.

## Under the Hood: Gears and Gizmos

DES, at its heart, is a [Feistel network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feistel_cipher), a structure that involves breaking up the data block into two halves and then passing them through a series of intricate transformations. While it may look so this isn't just some random shuffling of bits; it's a carefully orchestrated ballet of cryptographic operations designed to create confusion and diffusion.

Let's break down a single round of DES (remember, there are 16 of these bad boys):

1. **Initial Permutation (IP):** The 64-bit input block is permuted according to a predefined table. This shuffles the bits around, creating the initial state for the upcoming round.

2. **Key Transformation:** A 56-bit key (derived from the original 64-bit key with parity bits removed) is used to generate 16 subkeys, one for each of the 16 rounds. This involves further permutations and shifts.

3. **Splitting:** The permuted block is split into two 32-bit halves, Left (L) and Right (R).

4. **F-function (The Heart of DES):** This is where the magic happens. The R half undergoes a series of operations:

   - **Expansion Permutation (E):** The 32-bit R half is expanded to 48 bits, duplicating some bits according to a specific permutation table. This increases the diffusion effect.
   - **Key Mixing:** The expanded R half is XORed with the round key. This introduces the key's influence on the encryption process.
   - **S-box Substitution (The Secret Sauce):** The 48-bit result is then divided into eight 6-bit chunks. Each chunk is fed into a corresponding S-box (aka Substitution box). Each S-box is a 4x16 lookup table. The 6-bit input selects a row and column in the S-box, and the corresponding 4-bit value is the output. This non-linear substitution is crucial for DES's security.
   - **Permutation (P):** The 32-bit output from the S-boxes is permuted again, further scrambling the bits.

5. **XOR and Swap:** The output of the F-function is XORed with the L half. Then, the L and R halves are swapped. This completes one round.

6. **Repeat:** Steps 3-5 are repeated for 16 rounds, using a different subkey for each round.

7. **Final Permutation (IP^-1):** After 16 rounds, the two halves are combined, and with the resulting 64-bit block a final permutation is carried out. This is an inverse of the initial permutation (IP). This finally produces the ciphertext.

3DES is simply three applications of DES (encrypt-decrypt-encrypt). It inherits this complex structure but applies it multiple times. Increasing the computational cost but also (theoretically) the security. To be honest, I tried to float 5DES, and 7DES as even more secure versions of 3DES, but the community just rejects them every time.

This intricate dance of permutations, substitutions, and XOR operations makes DES a seemingly complex yet simple algorithm. The non-linearity introduced by the S-boxes is critical for its security, but the relatively small key size and block size ultimately led to its downfall. Understanding this underlying structure is key (get it!? I just had to!) to acknowledge the limitations of DES which were also the motivations behind the development of more robust ciphers like AES.

## Show Me The Code!

Using DES in production today is about as advisable as wearing a "kick me" post-it note through a high school hallway. But for educational purposes only, here's a snippet of Python code using the `pycryptodome` library. Remember that you _shouldn't_ be doing this:

```python
def simplified_f_function(right_half, subkey):
    """A simplified F-function (XOR with subkey)."""
    return right_half ^ subkey

def simplified_des_round(left_half, right_half, subkey):
    """A simplified DES round."""
    new_right = left_half ^ simplified_f_function(right_half, subkey)
    new_left = right_half
    return new_left, new_right

def simplified_des(plaintext, key, num_rounds=16):
    """A simplified DES implementation."""
    # Dummy subkey generation (in real DES, this is much more complex)
    subkeys = [key >> i for i in range(num_rounds)]  # Just shifting the key

    # Initial "permutation" (just splitting the plaintext for this example)
    left, right = plaintext[:len(plaintext) // 2], plaintext[len(plaintext) // 2:]

    # Rounds
    for i in range(num_rounds):
        left_int, right_int = int(left, 2), int(right, 2)
        left_int, right_int = simplified_des_round(left_int, right_int, subkeys[i])

        # Convert back to binary strings with padding
        left = bin(left_int)[2:].zfill(len(plaintext) // 2)
        right = bin(right_int)[2:].zfill(len(plaintext) // 2)

    # Final "permutation" (combining the halves)
    ciphertext = left + right
    return ciphertext

# Example usage
plaintext = "1010101001010101"  # Example 16-bit plaintext
key = 0b1111000011001010        # Example 16-bit key (highly insecure)
num_rounds = 4                  # Reduced number of rounds for illustration

ciphertext = simplified_des(plaintext, key, num_rounds)
print(f"Plaintext:  {plaintext}")   # 1010101001010101
print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}")  # 1000100000000101101001000011110

# ... and decryption
```

Again, this is a museum piece, not even a local-testing-ready implementation.

## Cracking the Code: From Brute Force to Sweet Treats

The real wake-up call came with the EFF's Deep Crack project. It demonstrated that brute-forcing a 56-bit key was no longer a theoretical exercise but a practical reality with the computational power available at the time. This, combined with advancements in cryptanalysis, like differential cryptanalysis, further weakened DES's defenses.

Wait a minute - what's this differential cryptanalysis all about? Imagine you're a codebreaker, and you don't know the key, but you can encrypt chosen plaintexts. Not so difficult to imagine right? Practically every system today. Differential cryptanalysis exploits the fact that changes in the input (plaintext) lead to predictable differences in the output (ciphertext), even without knowing the key. With this knowledge, by carefully analyzing these differences, or "differentials," across multiple chosen plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts, you can deduce information about the key itself. Neat!

In the context of DES, differential cryptanalysis targets the S-boxes, those lookup tables that are supposed to be the source of DES's cryptographic strength are after all a static lookup table. The attack works by identifying pairs of plaintexts with specific differences and observing the resulting differences in the intermediate values after passing through the S-boxes. By analyzing these differential patterns, cryptanalysts can deduce information about the key bits used in each round of DES.

While differential cryptanalysis doesn't instantly break DES, it significantly reduces the computational effort required to find the key. It gives you a cheat sheet for a really hard exam – you still need to put in some effort, but you have a significant advantage from having nothing. This type of attack, along with the ever-increasing power of computers, ultimately led to DES's demise. It also highlighted the need for ciphers with a much stronger resistance to cryptanalysis.

3DES, while offering a larger key space, wasn't entirely immune to these types of attacks, although the triple encryption made them significantly more difficult. The Sweet32 attack, exploiting a birthday paradox-style collision vulnerability, demonstrated that even triple encryption could be broken with enough effort (and a whole lot of birthday cakes, apparently). You can delve into the details of this attack [here](https://sweet32.info/). For the official pronouncements, refer to [NIST SP 800-67](https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2023/nist-to-withdraw-sp-800-67-rev-2).

## Legacy Lament: The Ghosts of Crypto Past (and Present, unfortunately)

DES and 3DES, despite their known vulnerabilities and exploits, continue to haunt the digital landscape even today. Migrating away from these cryptographic relics can be a herculean task, often fraught with challenges.

## The Great Crypto Migration: Why It's Harder Than It Sounds

Imagine trying to replace the engine of a car ...that's moving ...and has a leaking gas line. That's essentially what migrating away from DES/3DES in a legacy system feels like. Here's a breakdown of the pain points:

- **Tight Coupling:** These old ciphers are often deeply integrated with the application logic, woven into the very fabric of the system. It's not a simple matter of swapping libraries; it can require extensive code refactoring.
- **Dependency Hell:** Legacy systems are notorious for their complex and often undocumented dependencies. Changing one thing can trigger a cascade of breakages, turning a simple migration into a descent into the abyss of compatibility issues.
- **Testing Nightmares:** Answer this - how do you thoroughly test a cryptographic migration without bringing your entire system to a screeching halt? Comprehensive testing is crucial, but it can be incredibly time-consuming, resource-intensive, and a logistical nightmare, often involving late nights, copious amounts of caffeine, and the occasional existential crisis - at times all at once.
- **The "If It Ain't Broke..." Mentality:** Who are we kidding !? Sometimes there's resistance to change, especially when the system _appears_ to be functioning (ignoring the ticking time bomb). Convincing stakeholders to invest time, resources, and money in migration can be like pulling teeth.
- **Cost:** All of the above translates to one thing: _money_. Migrations are expensive, and justifying the cost to management can be a challenge, especially when there's no immediate, tangible benefit (besides, you know, ...preventing a potentially catastrophic security breach).

## The Legacy Lives On: Lessons for Modern Cryptography

If nothing else, our journey through DES and 3DES reveals a timeless lesson - one about cryptographic evolution. These algorithms demonstrate how even the most trusted security solutions become vulnerable over time. It does a great job at reinforcing the principles of key size importance and algorithm agility that we have discussed in Part 1. As we look ahead to our next deep dive into Blowfish, do remember that today's gold standard could be tomorrow's cautionary tale. If you're still running systems with DES or 3DES, consider this your wake-up call. You only have limited time to start planning that migration to modern algorithms. Your future self (and your security team) will thank you.
