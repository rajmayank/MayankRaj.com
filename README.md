# üëã Welcome to the Code Behind MayankRaj.com!

This repository is the backstage pass to my personal website, [MayankRaj.com](https://mayankraj.com/). It's where the digital magic happens, showcasing my journey as a solutions architect, a tech enthusiast with a penchant for puns, and a lifelong learner.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Who Am I?

I'm Mayank Raj, a violinist who codes (strings attached, of course!), a trekker who builds AI systems (reaching new heights in innovation), and a drone enthusiast who secures the digital world (always looking for a bird's-eye view). I'm passionate about bridging the gap between complex tech and real-world applications, making technology work smarter, not harder.

## üöÄ What's Under the Hood?

This project is fueled by the dynamic trio of Gatsby, React, and SCSS, creating a website that's both fast and visually appealing. Think of it as a well-orchestrated symphony of code, where each component plays its part in delivering a seamless user experience.

Here's a sneak peek at the highlights:

- **A design that's easy on the eyes:** Crafted with a touch of whimsy and a focus on clean aesthetics, the website reflects my personality and provides a delightful browsing experience.
- **Performance that's faster than a cheetah on a caffeine rush:** Built with speed in mind, the website leverages Gatsby's optimization superpowers to ensure lightning-fast load times.
- **Codebase so organized, Marie Kondo would approve:** Well-structured and maintainable code using modern JavaScript and SCSS best practices. It's a developer's dream come true!

## üß∞ Get Your Dev On!

Want to peek under the hood or set up the project locally? It's a piece of cake (or should I say, a slice of pie chart?)

1. **Fork the repository:** Hit that "Fork" button like you're clicking "Add to Cart" on a Black Friday deal.
2. **Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed:** You can grab them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
3. **Install dependencies:** Head over to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install # or yarn install
   ```

4. **Start the local server:** Fire it up with:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

Now you're all set to explore the code and witness the magic unfold!
